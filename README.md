# Series-Voltage-Regulator-with-Variable-Output
Circuit that steps down a DC input voltage to a lower, variable DC output voltage. The circuit features output stabilization through a negative feedback loop, through a differential amplifier. Other features: small thermal drift, over-current protection, over-temperature protection.
